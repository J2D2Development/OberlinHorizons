GENERAL IDEA
Normal site built on node/express and mongodb.  Each module (chat, video, picture sharing, project boards) is self-contained React app.  Chat is shared amonst them all?  How would we do that?

CURRENT
    1) Continue with login
        -express middleware ready- need function to pass token on route change or reload (if exists).  Where to store?  sessionStorage?  how to pass?
        -add client/server validation (check for blanks, implement zxcvbn?)
        -user should get an email confirmation (after approval by admin)- click the link and they can configure their profile (optional).
        -enable bcrypt for password



3) demo chat?  use react and local json (eventually react and mongodb with rxjs?)
4) fix mobile view
5) lazy loading image is cheap- make it work when it scrolls into view
6) previews for sched, chat, share?


TO START DEV ENVIRONMENT
    1) npm run mongo (start db)
    2) node server.js (start server)
        should be a way to config an npm script, but not working.
