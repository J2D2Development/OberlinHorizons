GENERAL IDEA
Normal site built on node/express and mongodb.  Each module (chat, video, picture sharing, project boards) is self-contained React app.  Chat is shared amonst them all?  How would we do that?

CURRENT
    1) Continue with login
        -express middleware ready- need function to pass token on route change or reload (if exists).  Where to store?  sessionStorage?  how to pass?
            -storing in session/localStorage works fine, but how to pass with each request?  can do it with ajax, but how to do it with normal http requests?  sessions?
                -tried to use ajax to hijack all link tags, pass auth token, then get response.  works for passing token, gets to endpoint past security on server, but can't seem to get it to then give me the page/file I want (returns everything as json).  also, always get failure response- why?
                -instead, maybe use passport with local strategy.
        -add client/server validation (check for blanks, implement zxcvbn?)
        -user should get an email confirmation (after approval by admin)- click the link and they can configure their profile (optional).
        -enable bcrypt for password
    2) admin user type
        -can view and approve/disable user accounts



3) demo chat?  use react and local json (eventually react and mongodb with rxjs?)
4) fix mobile view
5) lazy loading image is cheap- make it work when it scrolls into view
6) previews for sched, chat, share?


TO START DEV ENVIRONMENT
    1) npm run mongo (start db)
    2) node server.js (start server)
        should be a way to config an npm script, but not working.


ajax header hijacking (possible to use request.body instead)?
var token = window.localStorage.getItem('token');
if(token) {
    $.ajaxSetup({
        headers: {
            'x-access-token': token
        }
    })
}
