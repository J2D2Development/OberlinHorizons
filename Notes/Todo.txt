Todo

CURRENT
    1) Continue with login
        -add client/server validation (check for blanks, implement zxcvbn?)
        -add server processor (one url, send 'type' with data object and just handle on the backend)
        -plug into dummy (json) 'database' for testing
            -use fields below, but only email/password are required.  when user signs up, they should get an email confirmation (after approval by admin)- click the link and they can configure their profile (optional).
        -hook up to mongodb (local instance)
            -fields: fname, lname, email/username, password, profilepicid?, motto
        -enable bcrypt for password



3) demo chat?  use react and local json (eventually react and mongodb with rxjs?)
4) fix mobile view
5) lazy loading image is cheap- make it work when it scrolls into view
6) previews for sched, chat, share?
